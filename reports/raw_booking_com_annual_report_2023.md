**Booking.com's strategy focuses on providing seamless, comprehensive, and sustainable travel experiences**:

1. **Revenue Recognition**:
   - **Online Travel Reservation Services**: Booking.com's revenues are primarily generated by providing online travel reservation services. The company considers its customers to be the travel service providers, and in certain cases, the travelers themselves. Revenue is recognized on a net basis, with contracts typically involving payment terms such as commissions or margins on travel transactions. Revenues are recognized at the point in time when post-booking services are completed, and travelers begin using the arranged travel services.
      - **Agency Revenues**: Derived from transactions where Booking.com does not facilitate payments from travelers. Commission invoices are sent to travel service providers after travel is completed.
      - **Merchant Revenues**: Derived from transactions where Booking.com facilitates payments from travelers at the time of booking. This includes commissions, transaction net revenues, credit card processing rebates, customer processing fees, and ancillary fees.
   - **Advertising and Other Revenues**: Primarily recognized by subsidiaries such as KAYAK and OpenTable. Revenues include advertising placements, referral placements, reservation fees, and subscription fees.

2. **Incentives and Loyalty Programs**:
   - Booking.com provides various incentive programs and loyalty programs to consumers. These include referral bonuses, rebates, credits, and discounts. The estimated value of these incentives and loyalty points expected to be redeemed is recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time they are granted.

3. **Deferred Merchant Bookings**:
   - Cash payments received in advance of completing performance obligations are recorded as "Deferred merchant bookings" in the balance sheet. This includes amounts payable to travel service providers and estimated future revenue for commissions, margins, and fees. These amounts are subject to refunds for cancellations.

4. **Marketing Expenses**:
   - Marketing expenses are categorized into performance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. Performance marketing expenses are primarily measured by return on investment and consist of various advertising costs and incentives. Brand marketing expenses focus on building brand awareness and include television advertising, online video, display advertising, public relations, and sponsorships.

5. **Sales and Other Expenses**:
   - These expenses primarily include credit card processing fees, fees for third-party services, chargeback provisions, fraud prevention expenses, customer relations costs, and provisions for expected credit losses.

6. **Personnel Expenses**:
   - Consist of compensation to personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes, and employee benefits.

7. **Disaggregation of Revenue**:
   - **Revenue by Type of Service**: The majority of Booking.com's revenues, approximately 89% in 2022, 87% in 2021, and 88% in 2020, are derived from online accommodation reservation services. Revenue from all other sources of online travel reservation services and advertising and other revenues individually represent less than 10% of the company's total revenues for each year. The agency revenue is primarily from Booking.com's accommodation reservations.
   - **Revenue by Geographic Area**: Further details regarding revenue by geographic area can be found in Note 17 of the financial statements.

8. **Incentives and Loyalty Programs**:
   - Liabilities for incentives granted and loyalty programs are included in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, liabilities amounted to $143 million and $71 million, respectively.
   - During the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded a decrease of $28 million to the liability for loyalty programs, primarily due to changes in estimates of the number of loyalty points expected to be redeemed. Additionally, in 2020, the company offered additional rebates to customers under an incentive program at Booking.com, resulting in a reduction of revenue of $100 million.

9. **Refunds to Travelers**:
   - Due to the high level of cancellations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Booking.com incurred higher than normal cash outlays to refund travelers for prepaid reservations in 2020. This included situations where the company had already transferred the prepayment to the travel service provider. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded a reduction in revenue of $44 million for refunds paid or estimated to be payable to travelers without a corresponding expected recovery from the travel service providers.
